# Used-car-price-prediction-using-Machine-learning-and-Data-analytics-
Overview

This project aims to predict the price of used cars based on various features such as year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning, we can build a model that provides accurate price estimates, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.
Project Workflow

Data Collection & Preprocessing

Loaded dataset and handled missing values

Removed duplicates and outliers

Encoded categorical variables

Standardized/normalized numerical features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized feature distributions and correlations

Identified trends affecting car prices

Feature engineering and selection

Model Building & Training

Implemented multiple regression-based and tree-based models

Models used:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost Regressor

Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance

Model Evaluation

Performance metrics used:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Compared models to select the best-performing one

Deployment (Optional)

Built a Flask web app to deploy the model


Installation & Usage

Requirements

Python 3.x

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Flask (if deploying as a web app)

Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE




Results & Insights

The Random Forest model provided the best performance with the highest R² score and lowest error metrics.

Car prices are significantly affected by age, mileage, and fuel type.
